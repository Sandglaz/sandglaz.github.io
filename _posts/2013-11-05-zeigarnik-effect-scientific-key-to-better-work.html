    effect pretty much everywhere. It&#39;s because uncompleted tasks nag at you until
    you complete them.

    Have you ever wondered why cliffhangers work so well or why you just can''t get
    yourself to stop watching that series on Netflix (just one more episode)?</p><p>As
    writer Ernest Hemingway <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway"
    target="_blank">once said</a> about writing a novel, "it is the wait until the
    next day that is hard to get through." But the Zeigarnik effect can actually be
    used to positively impact your work productivity.</p><h1>The Zeigarnik effect
    and productivity</h1><p>Now you''re probably wondering how the Zeigarnik effect
    improves productivity. Since we experience intrusive thoughts about uncompleted
    tasks, the key to productivity is working in focused periods of time, while avoiding
    multi-tasking and disruptions. Getting a task done means peace of mind, while
    the intrusive thoughts mean that you will experience anxiety when leaving a task
    unfinished to focus on something else. Since multi-tasking is simply diverting
    your attention from one task to another (basically making the new task an interruption),
    your brain won''t allow you to fully focus on the new task because you have left
    the previous one uncompleted. That is why productivity techniques such as the
    <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/"
    target="_blank">Pomodoro technique</a> work so well. Of course, another key element
    is adapting the time spent on focused work to the task at hand; some tasks will
    require a longer period of focused work than others.</p><h1>Good news for procrastinators</h1><p>The
    Zeigarnik effect means good news for procrastinators: you are less likely to procrastinate
    once you actually start a task. You''re more inclined to finish something if you
    start it. So how do you actually get started? It depends on what <a title="5 Types
    of Procrastinators" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-types-of-procrastinators/"
    target="_blank">kind of procrastinator</a> you are. If you''re likely to procrastinate
    because you''re faced with a big project, then don''t think about starting with
    the hardest chunk of work. Start with what seems manageable in the moment. You''ll
    be more likely to finish the task simply because you started. The Zeigarnik effect
    shows us that the key to beating procrastination is starting somewhere… anywhere.</p><h1>Reward
    expectancy &amp; the Zeigarnik effect: why the 8-hour work day doesn''t work</h1><p><a
    href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00745.x/abstract;jsessionid=4F72DA5E5894EA2AA43D50029F32203C.f02t02"
    target="_blank">A study</a> published in the Journal of Personality  in 2006 showed
    that the Zeigarnik effect is undermined by reward expectancy. The study had subjects
    working on a task, interrupting them before the task was finished. While one group
    of subjects was told that they would receive an amount of money for participating
    in the study, the other group wasn''t told anything. The result was that 86% of
    the subjects who didn''t know about the reward chose to return to the task after
    they were interrupted, while only 58% of the subjects who were expecting the reward
    returned to the task. As the study was over and the reward was there, they found
    no reason to return to the task. What''s more, the subjects who were expecting
    the reward actually spent less time on the task once they did return to it.</p><p>Compare
    this to the 8-hour work day. The end of the work-day is just like the interruption
    in the study: once the 8 hours are done, the task is interrupted. And the pay
    for the 8 hours of work is the expected reward. The above study shows that reward
    expectancy actually undermines the Zeigarnik effect, and that rewarding task performance
    can lead to early task disengagement. In other words, the 8 hour work-day actually
    makes us unattached to our work. A great way to fight this sort of complacency
