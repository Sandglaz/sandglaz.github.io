Unfortunately, we have some sad news to share. Sandglaz will be shutting down
at the end of February and Sandglaz will cease to operate on March 1st, 2018.


No further charges will be made to your accounts and you will have access to all
paid features until the end of February.


We are grateful for all the support you have given us in the last 8 years.
We gave it our all but unfortunately couldn't create a sustainable business.
For this we are truly sorry.
